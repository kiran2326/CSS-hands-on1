    <h2>What is css?</h2>
    <div class="ls">
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
            <li><span class="sl">Css is not necessary</span><span class="hy">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li><span class="ul">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</span></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="un">
        <li>Inline - by using the styles attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="hl">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="class">
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
            style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element
            ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element 
            and it's used by javascript.      
         </p>
         <p>
            In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been
            targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
         </p>
         <p>
            There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
